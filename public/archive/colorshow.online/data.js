      description: "Relocating from Istanbul, Turkey to the Hague, Netherlands and traveling in between Western Europe and Turkey for the past 2 years, the work is one of the many works that express my state of in-betweenness. Untitled Mountain is a dialectic exploration of my experience during this time. Pink and black, soft and harsh, La Vie en rose and Memed My Hawk, depth and depthless, contrast each other in a digital installation. The metaphor of the Mountain that the work circles around, is constructed in the three layers of the work. The soft pink digital sculpture and its harsh black depthless shadow that is experienced at the very beginning reminds of a dual nature. Exploring the panorama, the metaphor of the Mountain is experienced next with a panorama of Mont Blanc, a great tourist attraction in Europe. In the third physical layer of the black exhibition space, The duality of mountain in the two cultures is explained through the excerpts taken from the Turkish writer Yashar Kemal’s book Memed My Hawk, which explain what a Mountain is in Turkish culture; a prison, a metal cage, violence and terror, much different from what a Mountain means in Western European culture. In a similar dialectic relationship is the atmosphere itself, La Vie en Rose (Life in Pink) by Louis Armstrong and the black room that is the digital space.",

      description: "Can colour be political? - Many artists say without thinking “Everything is political” if that is true it’s important to stop and think how the colour affects our decisions, mood and atmosphere. In “The Colour in Anything” we explore the many political works of artists all over the world. Paying special attention to their use of colour. Stop and view each work with patience, ask yourself “How does this make me feel?”, “What does this remind me of?”, “How can this influence me?” Three artists show their work in a collective exhibition sharing their view of politics through colour and art, Agnar Freyr, Andy Warhol and KP Brehmer. “Woolen Data (2020)” series will be exhibited by Agnar alongside his “Colour of Politics (2020)”. Warhol’s famous portraits of political figures will also be on display, ranging from Chairman Mao to the Queen of England. The artist’s own iconic images of 20th-century leaders inspired spirited debate about the pairing of politics and pop culture. KP Brehmer was influenced by the emerging new definitions of art and direction as the pop art around 1960, but also by the political rebellion of the younger generation of the 60s, he defined a new form of language, which, in opposition to abstract art of the 50s, served realistic motifs. KP Brehmer uses data and colour to tell a unique and important story. The exhibition is held in the wonderful modern building Kjarvalsstaðir, in Reykjavík Iceland. It’s gray concrete outside and white walled interior is a perfect neutral canvas to exhibit the works.",

There is no better place to travel in time.\nYour ear is a spiral, as well as the sea shell. Dive high into the shell and hear what is left to hear–the echoes of the infinite Now, the Silence of it, the Noise of it. \n\nThis is as high as I can go\nHow do you know that you know it?",

Duplicating itself inside a book in order to own the power of decisions, to draw the borders in order to hit within the borders. A system- that we can call a little surgery, authorising the viewer to step back from what they perceive, letting them add one more canvas to Monet’s 37 depictions. Teaching them things with coding the color right in their headquarters, 255,0,0. An emerge - that has been always carried by every particle in air but somehow hidden, never exposed. Greeting the viewer with a warm welcome, releasing the intensions as an extension —— soon adapting, forced and artificial but sitting on the chair of daily basis. In the middle of a desert, with no escape route defined or traced.. Attaching a pencil to their hand, carrying the symptoms of emerge, to merge ones traces with the coded urge.",

I lived in a building that was at the edge of the city enclosed by the beltway of Utrecht. I considered my architectural surrounding as monotone, gray and to some extend depressing. There was a day in May when I was coming back from a cycle trip through the countryside north of Utrecht. The whole day I was cycling through pittoreske brown hamlets and green fields when suddenly from 2km distance I saw a huge refreshing gray block towering above the green. I was struck by the natural beauty of it, how it broke with the environment, but also therefore how it fitted in. I couldn’t keep my eyes off the whole scene until I was almost at the front door of the building. It was only by then that I realised I was home.\n",

People are moved by color because it’s subconsciously evoking feelings in them.\n\nAlmost every color has a name. A multitude of those is an outcome of people’s imagination and sensibility. One of the industries, that sales is based mainly on the name rather than a product, is color cosmetic industry. Companies are selling us a dream, not a product. \n\nMy research was based on names of lipsticks which for me are a symbol of empowerment and independence. In art used as a powerful tool (ex. Ewa Partum, Martha Rosler) and at the same time, in lives of many all around the world, the tool of extraordinary sexism.\n\nBrands are pushing it to the limit where advertising is more sexist than it could ever be - selling young, human beings lipstick with a Daddy’s Name name on it.\n",
