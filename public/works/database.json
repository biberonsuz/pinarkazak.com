        "description": "The #teargas Archive is an online research project looking into the use of social media, for news reporting in the information age. The research process looked into the concept of 'artificial clouds', both in terms of cloud storage, and in terms of cloud forms; smoke, explosion, teargas. At the intersection was digital reports of events representing tragedies and violence. <br><br>The work explores our relation to these two understandings of artificial clouds, focusing on 'teargas' and 'online archive', specifically Instagram and Twitter archives. The web app includes periodic scrapings from the Twitter and Instagram Search API's, with the keyword '#teargas'. The client side of the app is the result of these scrapings, which is a proposition for a postmodern way of news reporting, dependant on individual right to digital communication and online archiving, on the topic #teargas.",

        "description": "Stuck Figures are a style of drawing inspired from the feeling of feeling stuck. First developed as drawings of stick figures stuck between text, they later developed into RISO prints, ink stamps, and later an installation. Specifically the installation plays with the idea of color and opacity, and speaks of the uneasy feeling of feeling stuck in an abundance of space. This idea was later explored again using the painting medium, playing more with the idea of space, as opposed to the idea of opacity. It was also later developed into a tote bag, going back to the idea of transparency, and later developed into transparent and colourful coasters. ",
